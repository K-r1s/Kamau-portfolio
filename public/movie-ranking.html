<h3>A poem I love</h3>
<p>You are good when you are one with yourself.<br />
Yet when you are not one with yourself you are not evil.<br />
For a divided house is not a den of thieves; it is only a divided house.<br />
And a ship without rudder may wander aimlessly among perilous isles yet sink not to the bottom.<br />
