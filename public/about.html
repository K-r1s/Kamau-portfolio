<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have a key interest in expanding my knowledge and better understand my spirituality and purpose. I believe that
  there is more to this world than what was programmed into our subconscious by our parents and the environment we grew
  up in. Everyone can create his/her own reality by thoughts. “You are what you think” and thus the quality of a man’s
  life is determined by the quality of his own thoughts. By consciously and consistently thinking of what you want and
  not what you fear you have the power to change your reality. This goes back to the law of mentalism a book by Victor
  Segno one of my favorite books which talks about the power of thoughts. On the first page, he states” Thoughts are
  things endowered with bodies, breath, and wings that we send them forth to fill the world with good results or ill.
  “We should therefore be mindful of what we think as these thoughts have an influence on the quality of life that we
  live. If you think failure you’ll get and if you think success you’ll get success “Cause and Effect.” Remember if you
  can see it, you can have it.</p>

  <p>I also have a key interest in doing artistic things. I always feel there is a connection between aesthetic things and
  creativity. I am naturally drawn to being innovative and creating unique things. That’s why I chose the tech field as
  there is space for me to be creative and focus on my own projects. This field is not like the educational field,
  nursing, law, or other fields where you have to do repetitive things with minimum room for creativity. Apart from
  tech, I am also interested in other arts such as poetry. Poetry provides space for me to express my words and thoughts
  without being judged. I find it as a way to look for clarity in my thoughts and feelings. Human psychology is also
  another field I am interested in. I always want to understand more about the human mind and how factors such as power,
  fame, and money influence our decisions.</p>

  <p>Self-development is also another thing that I always put my focus on. This includes working my mind, body, and soul.
  For the mind, you have to work on gaining more knowledge about yourself and the world, for the body you have to
  exercise and go to the gym to achieve the athletic physique and for the soul you have to connect more with God. I
  believe that when you work on these 3 pillars, you will attain health, happiness, and success. I believe that when you
  work on yourself, you improve the quality of your life and attract greater things in your life.</p>
